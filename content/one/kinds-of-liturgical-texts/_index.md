# What are Liturgical Texts?

In Orthodox Christian worship, liturgical texts are the words used in worship. These include Scripture, prayers, litanies, hymns, and rubrics. They are traditionally found in *service books*. Different types of texts are spoken, intoned or chanted by clergy, by cantors or choirs, or by the congregation. *Rubrics* are not delivered aloud, but rather give instructions about liturgical actions.
