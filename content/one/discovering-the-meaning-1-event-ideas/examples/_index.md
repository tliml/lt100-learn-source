Notice that in each of the examples, a **noun** in the first version is replaced in the simpler version by a **verb**.

In each case, the bolded noun expresses an EVENT idea; that is, something which someone does. In many languages, EVENTS are usually expressed by VERBS. Many languages use a verb where English would use a noun.

When preparing to translate, it is helpful to look for any EVENT ideas in the passage, especially those which are expressed by some form other than a verb. Re-express the meaning using a verb to express the EVENT idea. This is useful for two reasons:

1. It helps to reveal more precisely the meaning of the source text. The meaning, especially the relationships between ideas, often appears more clearly when the EVENT ideas are expressed as verbs.

2. Often this restructuring will help the translator to find an easier way to express the meaning in the Receptor Language.

**REMEMBER:**

When studying a passage in preparation for translation,

1. Find all the EVENT ideas and underline them.
1. Restructure, expressing all the EVENT ideas as verbs.
