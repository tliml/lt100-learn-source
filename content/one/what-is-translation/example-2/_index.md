Take a short passage written in your own language. Two or three sentences is enough. First, word-by-word, underneath each word in the language,
write the English for that word. Does this make a translation that someone will understand? Then make a proper translation, expressing the meaning
of the passage in a natural way in English.

Now do the same thing with a song written in your language. One verse-- between two and six lines, for example-- is enough. First, word-by-word,
underneath each word in the language, write the English for that word. Does this make a translation that someone will understand? Then make a proper
translation, expressing the meaning of the passage in a natural way in English. Now try to sing the song in English. Although the translation can
be understood, can it be sung in the same way as the original? How would your English translation have to be adjusted in order to be sung?
