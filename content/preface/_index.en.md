# Introduction to Liturgical Translation

This course, LT - 100, "Introduction to Liturgical Translation," is written primarily for those who are preparing to translate liturgical texts of the Orthodox Church into their own mother tongue. It is designed as a self-study course.

The aim of the course is twofold:
1. That the translator should gain an in-depth understanding of the principles of liturgical translation, and
1. That he or she be able to apply these principles effectively to achieve an accurate, meaningful, and liturgically appropriate translation.
