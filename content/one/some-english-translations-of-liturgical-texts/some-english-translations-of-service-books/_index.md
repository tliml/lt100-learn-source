In Byzantine music, many hymns are sung according to a specific melody. Translations of these hymns must have a similar meter to the original Greek text, so that the same melody can be used. Translations that are designed to be sung according to Byzantine melodies are called *metered* texts. Translations that are not designed to be sung according to Byzantine melodies are called *unmetered* texts.

### Versions in an older style of English

* **The Service Book of the Orthodox Church (Hapgood)** translated from Church Slavonic by Isabel Florence Hapgood in 1907. This is one of the first comprehensive service books to have been available in English. It contains the text of the most common services and hymns used in the Orthodox Church. Because it was translated from Slavonic, it does not always reflect the accurate meaning of Greek texts, and the hymns are *unmetered.*
