#### Original

Οἱ τὰ Χερουβεὶμ μυστικῶς εἰκονίζοντες,  
καὶ τῇ ζωοποιῷ Τριάδι τὸν τρισάγιον ὕμνον προσᾴδοντες,  
πᾶσαν νῦν βιοτικὴν ἀποθώμεθα μέριμναν.  

Ὡς τὸν Βασιλέα τῶν ὅλων ὑποδεξόμενοι.  

Ταῖς ἀγγελικαῖς ἀοράτως δορυφορούμενον τάξεσιν. Ἀλληλούϊα. Ἀλληλούϊα. Ἀλληλούϊα.

#### English (Lash)

We, who in a mystery represent the Cherubim  
and sing the thrice-holy hymn to the life-giving Trinity,  
let us now lay aside every care of this life.  

For we are about to receive the
King of all,  

invisibly escorted by the
angelic hosts. Alleluia.

#### English (GOA)

Let us, who mystically represent the Cherubim  
and who sing the thrice-holy hymn to the lifecreating Trinity,  
now lay aside every worldly care.  

So that we may receive the King of all.  

Who is invisibly escorted by the angelic hosts.
Alleluia. Alleluia. Alleluia.
