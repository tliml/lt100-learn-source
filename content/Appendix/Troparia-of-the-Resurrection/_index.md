Ἀναστὰς ἐκ τοῦ μνήματος, καὶ τὰ δεσμὰ
διαῤῥήξας τοῦ ᾍδου, ἔλυσας τὸ κατάκριμα, τοῦ
θανάτου Κύριε, πάντας ἐκ τῶν παγίδων τοῦ ἐχθροῦ
ῥυσάμενος, ἐμφανίσας σεαυτὸν τοῖς, Ἀποστόλοις
σου, ἐξαπέστειλας αὐτοὺς ἐπὶ τὸ κήρυγμα, καὶ δι'
αὐτῶν τὴν εἰρήνην παρέσχες τῇ οἰκουμένῃ, μόνε
πολυέλεε.

#### English (Lash)

By rising from the tomb and bursting through the bonds of Hell, you abolished
the sentence of death, O Lord, delivering all from the snares of the
foe. Having shown yourself to your Apostles, you sent them out to preach,
and through them you gave peace to the whole world, you who alone are
full of mercy.

#### English (SD)

When You rose from the sepulcher and broke
the bonds of Hades, You repealed the sentence of
death, O Lord, and delivered all from the snares
of the enemy. And when You showed yourself
to Your Apostles, You sent them out to preach,
and through them You granted peace to the whole
world, O only very merciful One.
