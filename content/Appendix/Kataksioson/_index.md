#### Original

Καταξίωσον, Κύριε, ἐν τῇ ἑσπέρᾳ ταύτῃ, ἀναμαρτήτους φυλαχθῆναι ἡμᾶς. Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, Κύριε, ὁ Θεὸς τῶν Πατέρων ἡμῶν, καὶ αἰνετὸν καὶ δεδοξασμένον τὸ ὄνομά σου εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας. Ἀμήν. Γένοιτο, Κύριε, τὸ ἔλεός σου ἐφ' ἡμᾶς, καθάπερ ἠλπίσαμεν ἐπὶ σέ. Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, Κύριε, δίδαξόν με τὰ δικαιώματά σου. Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, Δέσποτα, συνέτισον μὲ τὰ δικαιώματά σου. Εὐλογητὸς εἶ, Ἅγιε, φώτισόν με τοῖς δικαιώμασί σου. Κύριε, τὸ ἔλεός σου εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα· τὰ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σου μὴ παρίδῃς. Σοὶ πρέπει αἶνος, σοὶ πρέπει ὕμνος, σοὶ δόξα πρέπει, τῷ Πατρὶ καὶ τῷ Υἱῷ καὶ τῷ Ἁγίῳ Πνεύματι, νῦν καὶ ἀεὶ καὶ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας των αἰώνων.

Grant, Lord, to keep us this
evening without sin. Blessed are
you, Lord, the God of our fathers,
and praised and glorified is your
name to the ages. Amen.


Let your mercy, Lord be upon us,
as we have hoped in you.


Blessed are you, Lord: teach me
your statutes.


Blessed are you, Master: make me
understand your statutes.


Blessed are you, Holy One: enlighten
me with your statutes.


Lord, your mercy is for ever; do not
scorn the work of your hands. To
you praise is due, to you song is
due, to you glory is due, to the Father,
and to the Son, and to the
Holy Spirit, now and for ever, and to the ages of ages. Amen.
