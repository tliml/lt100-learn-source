#### Original

Πληρωθήτω τὸ στόμα ἡμῶν αἰνέσεως Κύριε,
ὅπως ἀνυμνήσωμεν τὴν δόξαν σου, ὅτι ἠξίωσας
ἡμᾶς τῶν ἁγίων σου μετασχεῖν μυστηρίων·
τήρησον ἡμᾶς ἐν τῷ σῷ ἁγιασμῷ, ὅλην τὴν ἡμέραν
μελετῶντας τὴν δικαιοσύνην σου. Ἀλληλούϊα,
ἀλληλούϊα, ἀλληλούϊα.

#### English (Lash)

Let our mouth be filled with
your praise, O Lord, that we may
sing of your glory, for you have
counted us worthy to partake of
your holy, divine, immortal and lifegiving
Mysteries; keep us in your
holiness, that we may meditate on
your righteousness all the day long.
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
