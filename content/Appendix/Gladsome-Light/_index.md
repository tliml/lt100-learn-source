Φῶς ἱλαρὸν ἁγίας δόξης, ἀθανάτου Πατρός, οὐρανίου, ἁγίου, μάκαρος, Ἰησοῦ Χριστέ, ἐλθόντες ἐπὶ τὴν ἡλίου δύσιν, ἰδόντες φῶς ἑσπερινόν, ὑμνοῦμεν Πατέρα, Υἱόν, καὶ ἅγιον Πνεῦμα Θεόν. Ἄξιόν σε ἐν πᾶσι καιροῖς, ὑμνεῖσθαι φωναῖς αἰσίαις, Υἱὲ Θεοῦ, ζωὴν ὁ διδούς· Διὸ ὁ κόσμος σὲ δοξάζει.

#### English (Lash)

O joyful Light of the holy glory of the
immortal, heavenly, holy, blessed
Father, O Jesus Christ. Now that
we have come to the setting of the
sun and see the evening light, we
sing the praise of God, Father, Son
and Holy Spirit. It is right at all
times to hymn you with holy voices,
Son of God, giver of life. Therefore
the world glorifies you.

Gladsome light of holy glory of the holy, blessed, heavenly, immortal Father, O Jesus Christ: arriving at the hour of sunset and having seen the evening light, we praise the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, God. It is worthy for You to be praised at all times with happy voices, O Son of God and Giver of life; and therefore the world glorifies You.
