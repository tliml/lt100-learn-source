The field of Bible translation often discusses the issues of "literal" (or "formal equivalence") versus "meaning-based" (or "dynamic equivalence) translation. This is highly relevant to liturgical translation.

#### **EXAMPLE: Matthew 3:8**

*Greek text with word-for-word key in English:*

| ποιήσατε | οὖν | καρπὸν | ἄξιον | τῆς | μετανοίας, |
| -------- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- | ---------- |
| piisate | oun | karpon | aksion | tis | metanias, |
| do/ make/ produce | therefore | fruit | fit/ appropriate | of-the | repentance. |

*English versions:* (An explanation of abbreviations is given in Chapter 3)  
A. Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: (KJV)  
B. Bear fruit that befits repentance, (RSV)  
C. Produce fruit in keeping with repentance. (NIV)  
D. Then prove your repentance by the fruit it bears; (NEB)  
E. But if you are repentant, produce the appropriate fruit, (JB)  
F. Do those things that will show that you have turned from your sins. (GNB)  
G. Go and do something to show that your hearts are really changed.  
H. ...prove that you have turned from sin by doing worthy deeds. (LB)  

Translations A - E are all fairly **literal**. They follow the form of the Greek closely. For example, notice that  
(a) They all keep the word "fruit" although this is an idiom or figure of speech in Greek.  
(b) Except for (E) they all keep the abstract noun "repentance" as a noun, following the grammar of the Greek text.  
(c) They all follow the same order of words and clauses as the Greek text.  

Translations F - H are all **meaning-based.** They re-express the meaning of the original message in a clear and natural way.

**REMEMBER:**  
A **LITERAL** translation is one that follows as closely as possible the **grammatical form** of the language which is used in the original message.  
A **MEANING-BASED** translation is one that aims to express the exact **meaning** of the original message in a way that is natural in the new language.

**A meaning-based translation may:**
1. Change the order of the words; it will use the order which is most clear and natural in the language into which the translation is being made;
1. Change the expressions or idioms; it will use the words which give the meaning of the original clearly, even though this may not be the same idiom as in the original message.

**A meaning-based translation is sometimes also called:**
1. *"meaning-equivalent"* : It communicates the same meaning as the original message.
1. *"idiomatic"* : It uses the natural, idiomatic form of the language into which the translation is being made.
1. *"dynamic"* " It aims to produce the same impact on the hearers as the original message had on the original hearers or readers. It aims to stir the hearer to action as the original version did.

#### FURTHER EXAMPLES

For each of the following passages, for each English version.
1. Underline any places in the translation where the translator has changed **the form** of the original (that is, where he has used different grammar or a different idiom);
1. For each translation, write down whether you feel the translation is "literal" or "meaning-based." You may qualify your answers as "very literal," "fairly literal," "meaning-based" or "very meaning-based."
1. For the Old Testament passages, compare the Hebrew key to the Greek key. How literal or meaning-based is the Greek translation of the Hebrew?  

If there is a translation of any of these verses in your own language, or in a national language that you know, also look up the translation of each verse to see whether it is literal or meaning-based.
