# STARTING TO TRANSLATE

A very importand part of the training programme for a translator is translation practice. The best way to learn to translate is by translating.

For a first translation project, choose texts that are:
* Particularly relevant, interesting and helpful for your people;
* Not too long; a set of hymns in the Eight Modes is good.
* Not too difficult.

Below are some suggestions for translation projects that would be a good starting point:

1. Fixed Hymns at the Divine Liturgy
1. [The Symbol of Faith](https://www.goarch.org/-/the-nicene-creed?inheritRedirect=true)
1. [The Lord's Prayer](https://www.goarch.org/-/the-lord-s-prayer)
1. [The Resurrection Apolytikia]() in the Eight Modes
1. [The Dogmatic Theotokia](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12JYrmyWGikZINxWZXY7wozk-exp7NRYdscc928tZCV0/edit?usp=sharing) of Resurrectional Vespers in the Eight Modes
1. [The Lenten Prayer of St Ephrem the Syrian](https://www.goarch.org/-/lenten-prayer-of-st-ephrem-the-syrian)
