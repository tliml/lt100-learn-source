### Translations of the New Testament (Greek)

#### 1. Some reliable versions that keep fairly close to the structure of the original text.
* **Lexham English Bible (LEB)**: This is a very literal translation made for Biblical scholarship. It is derived from an interlinear translation of the Greek New Testament.
* **Revised Standard Version (RSV)**: This version has become the standard version for use in many churches and schools.
* **New King James Version (NKJV)**: This version is used by the Orthodox Study Bible, and is based on the *Textus Receptus* which is very similar to the *Byzantine text-type* which is used in Orthodox services.
* **New International Version (NIV)**: Another careful modern version, less literal than the RSV. This version gives a reliable guide to follow where there are differences of interpretation in different versions.
* **English Standard Version (ESV)**: Another careful modern version, less literal than the RSV.
* **New American Standard Bible (NASB)**
* **Translator's New Testament (TNT)**: A rather literal translation, prepared by specialists in New Testament studies. It includes some helpful notes and a glossary.

#### 2. Other reliable modern versions in a rather formal style of English
* **New English Bible (NEB)**: An accurate translation made by good scholars. The language is rather formal, and it is therefore not always so easy to understand as the *Good News Bible*. It is useful for reference.
* **New Jerusalem Bible (NJB)**: An accurate translation made by good scholars. Its footnotes and introductions give helpful explanations of the text.

#### 3. Versions in everyday modern English
* **Good News Bible (GNB)**: A popular version in everyday, modern English, easy to understand. It aims to express the meaning of the original text in a way that ordinary people can understand. This version was also formerly called *Today's English Version.*
* **J. B. Phillips (JBP)**: A very useful, idiomatic translation using lively natural English.
* **New Living Translation (NLT)**: Another lively translation in everyday English, aiming to communicate the meaning of the Scriptures in a way that will be readily understood by ordinary people. It is useful for reference and has some good ideas for expression, but should be used with caution as it sometimes over-simplifies the meaning.
* **Amplified Bible**: An expanded paraphrase that gives alternative words and phrases, trying to bring out the full meaning of the original text. It should also be used with caution as it is not always very accurate.
* **Barclay's Version**: A fairly reliable version in simple style English. The translation accompanies a series of commentaries on the New Testament books.

#### 4. Versions in an older style of English
* **King James Version (KJV), also called the Authorised Version**: For three hundred years, the King James Version was the standard version of the Bible in English, and it is still in common use by many people. However, because the English language has changed since the time when this translation was made, it is now difficult for people to understand. Also since the time when this translation was made, further discoveries of early biblical manuscripts have made it possible for scholars to be more sure of the original reading of the text at certain points. The King James Version is translated from the *Textus Receptus*, which is very similar to the *Byzantine text-type* used by the Orthodox Church.

### Translations of the Psalter (Greek)

Because the Psalter is the part of the Old Testament most frequently used in the Orthodox Church, a number of translations have been made of the Greek Psalter. The following editions are formatted for use in Orthodox Christian services:

#### Versions in modern English

* **The Ancient Faith Psalter**
* **The Psalter According to the Seventy** translated by Fr Peter Chamberas

#### Versions in an older style of English

* **The Psalter According to the Seventy** translated by Holy Transfiguration Monastery
* **The Psalms of David** translated by Donald Sheehan
* **A Psalter for Prayer** or the *Jordanville Psalter*
