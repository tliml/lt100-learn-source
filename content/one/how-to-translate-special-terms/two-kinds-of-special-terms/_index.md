There are two kinds of SPECIAL TERMS:

> (1) Those words that (with very few exceptions) have the same meaning in every context in which they occur. These are especially common in rubrics (liturgical instructions). Examples are: *bishop, priest, deacon, catechumen, sacrament.* These are also known as KEY TERMS.

> (2) Words that have several different senses according to the context in which they occur. Examples are: _______ . Such words may need to be translated in different ways in different contexts, in order to give the correct sense in each context.
