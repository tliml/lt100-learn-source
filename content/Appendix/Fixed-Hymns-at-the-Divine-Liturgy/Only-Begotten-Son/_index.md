#### Original:

Ὁ μονογενὴς Υἱὸς καὶ Λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ *  
ἀθάνατος ὑπάρχων, *  
καὶ καταδεξάμενος διὰ τὴν ἡμετέραν σωτηρίαν *  
σαρκωθῆναι ἐκ τῆς ἁγίας Θεοτόκου *  
καὶ ἀειπαρθένου Μαρίας, άτρέπτως ἐνανθρωπήσας· *  
σταυρωθείς τε, Χριστὲ ὁ Θεός, *  
θανάτω θάνατον πατήσας· *  
εἷς ὤν τῆς Ἁγίας Τρίαδος, *  
συνδοξαζόμενος τῷ Πατρὶ καὶ τω Ἁγιῳ Πνεύματι, *  
σῶσον ἡμᾶς.

save us!
