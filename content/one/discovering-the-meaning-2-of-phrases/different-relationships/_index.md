As you will see from the examples below, many quite different relationships are expressed by "of" phrases. This is especially true where one of the nouns expresses an EVENT idea.

At this point we are concerned primarily with discovering the relationship between the two parts of the "of" phrase. How the ideas might be expressed in the translation is a different question, which will be considered later in the full context of each passage.

Notice that in re-expressing the meaning, some participants have been made explicit. Information that has been made explicit is enclosed in parentheses ( ).
