#### Original

Νῦν ἀπολύεις τον δοῦλόν σου, Δέσποτα, κατὰ τὸ ῥῆμά σου, ἐν εἰρήνῃ· ὅτι εἶδον οἱ ὀφθαλμοί μου τὸ σωτήριόν σου, ὃ ἡτοίμασας κατὰ πρόσωπον πάντων τῶν λαῶν· φῶς εἰς ἀποκάλυψιν ἐθνῶν, καὶ δόξαν λαοῦ σου Ἰσραήλ.

#### English (Lash)

Now, Master, you let your
servant depart in peace, according
to your word; for my eyes have
seen your Salvation, which you
have prepared before the face of all
peoples, a Light to bring revelation
to the nations, and the Glory of your
people Israel.

#### English (NKJV)

Lord, now You are letting Your servant
depart in peace, according to Your word; for my
eyes have seen Your salvation which You have
prepared before the face of all peoples. A light to
bring revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of
Your people Israel.
