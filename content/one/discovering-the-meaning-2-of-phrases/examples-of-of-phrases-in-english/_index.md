An "of" phrase in English is a phrase in which two nouns are joined by the word "of":

* the house **of** my father
* the tail **of** the dog
* a bucket **of** water
* the song **of** Miriam

The technical word for this kind of construction is a *genitive construction.*

Notice that in English, some "of" phrases can also be expressed by adding -'s to the noun that follows "of":

* my father's house
* the dog's tail
* Miriam's song
* the children's ball

The same relationship can be expressed by a "possessive pronoun," such as "his," "your," "my," or "our." This is also a *genitive construction*, even though it is not signalled by "of."

* his house
* its tail
* her song

English uses many "of" phrases, and other genitive constructions; Greek, the original language of the Divine Services, uses the genitive construction even more than English does.
