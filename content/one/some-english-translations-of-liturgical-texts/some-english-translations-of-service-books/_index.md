### Translations of the New Testament (Greek)

#### 1. Some reliable versions that keep fairly close to the structure of the original text.
* **Lexham English Bible (LEB)**: This is a very literal translation made for Biblical scholarship. It is derived from an interlinear translation of the Greek New Testament.
* **Revised Standard Version (RSV)**: This version has become the standard version for use in many churches and schools.
* **New King James Version (NKJV)**: This version is used by the Orthodox Study Bible, and is based on the *Textus Receptus* which is very similar to the *Byzantine text-type* which is used in Orthodox services.
* **New International Version (NIV)**: Another careful modern version, less literal than the RSV. This version gives a reliable guide to follow where there are differences of interpretation in different versions.
* **English Standard Version (ESV)**: Another careful modern version, less literal than the RSV.
* **New American Standard Bible (NASB)**
* **Translator's New Testament (TNT)**: A rather literal translation, prepared by specialists in New Testament studies. It includes some helpful notes and a glossary.

#### 2. Other reliable modern versions in a rather formal style of English
* **New English Bible (NEB)**: An accurate translation made by good scholars. The language is rather formal, and it is therefore not always so easy to understand as the *Good News Bible*. It is useful for reference.
* **New Jerusalem Bible (NJB)**: An accurate translation made by good scholars. Its footnotes and introductions give helpful explanations of the text.

#### 3. Versions in everyday modern English
* **Good News Bible (GNB)**: A popular version in everyday, modern English, easy to understand. It aims to express the meaning of the original text in a way that ordinary people can understand. This version was also formerly called *Today's English Version.*
