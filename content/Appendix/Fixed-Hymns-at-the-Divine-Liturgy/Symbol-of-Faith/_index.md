#### Original

Πιστεύω εἰς ἕνα Θεόν, Πατέρα, Παντοκράτορα, ποιητὴν οὐρανοῦ καὶ γῆς, ὁρατῶν τε πάντων καὶ ἀοράτων. 

Καὶ εἰς ἕνα Κύριον Ἰησοῦν Χριστόν, τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ, τὸν ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς γεννηθέντα πρὸ πάντων τῶν αἰώνων· φῶς ἐκ φωτός, Θεὸν ἀληθινὸν ἐκ Θεοῦ ἀληθινοῦ, γεννηθέντα οὐ ποιηθέντα, ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρί, δι' οὗ τὰ πάντα ἐγένετο. Τὸν δι' ἡμᾶς τοὺς ἀνθρώπους καὶ διὰ
τὴν ἡμετέραν σωτηρίαν κατελθόντα ἐκ τῶν
οὐρανῶν καὶ σαρκωθέντα ἐκ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου
καὶ Μαρίας τῆς Παρθένου καὶ ἐνανθρωπήσαντα.
Σταυρωθέντα τε ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν ἐπὶ Ποντίου Πιλάτου,
καὶ παθόντα καὶ ταφέντα. Καὶ ἀναστάντα τῇ
τρίτῃ ἡμέρα κατὰ τὰς Γραφάς. Καὶ ἀνελθόντα εἰς
τοὺς οὐρανοὺς καὶ καθεζόμενον ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ
Πατρός. Καὶ πάλιν ἐρχόμενον μετὰ δόξης κρῖναι
ζῶντας καὶ νεκρούς, οὗ τῆς βασιλείας οὐκ ἔσται
τέλος. 

Καὶ εἰς τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, τὸ Κύριον,
τὸ ζωοποιόν, τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Πατρὸς ἐκπορευόμενον,
τὸ σὺν Πατρὶ καὶ Υἱῷ συμπροσκυνούμενον καὶ
συνδοξαζόμενον, τὸ λαλῆσαν διὰ τῶν προφητῶν.


Εἰς μίαν, Ἁγίαν, Καθολικὴν καὶ Ἀποστολικὴν
Ἐκκλησίαν. Ὁμολογῶ ἓν βάπτισμα εἰς ἄφεσιν
ἁμαρτιῶν. Προσδοκῶ ἀνάστασιν νεκρῶν. Καὶ
ζωὴν τοῦ μέλλοντος αἰῶνος. Ἀμήν.

I believe in one God, * Father,
Almighty, * Maker of heaven and
earth, * and of all things visible and
invisible.  

And in one Lord, Jesus
Christ,* the only-begotten Son
of God, * begotten from the Father *
before all ages, * Light from Light, *
true God from true God, * begotten * not made, * consubstantial with
the Father,* through him all things
were made. * For our sake and for
our salvation * he came down from
heaven, * and was incarnate from
the Holy Spirit * and the Virgin Mary * and became man. * He was crucified
also for us under Pontius Pilate,*
and suffered and was buried; * he rose again on the third day, *
in accordance with the Scriptures, * and ascended into heaven * and
is seated at the right hand of the Father. * He is coming again in glory * to judge the living and the dead, *
and his kingdom will have no end.


And in the Holy Spirit, * the Lord, * the Giver of life, * who proceeds
from the Father, * who together
with Father and Son is worshipped * and together glorified; * who 
spoke through the Prophets.


In one, Holy, * Catholic and Apostolic
Church. * I confess one Baptism * for the forgiveness of sins. *
I await the resurrection of the dead * and the life of the age to come.

Amen.

I believe in one God, Father Almighty,
Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things
visible and invisible. 

And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the
Father before all ages; Light of Light, true God
of true God, begotten, not created, of one essence
with the Father through Whom all things were
made. Who for us men and for our salvation
came down from heaven and was incarnate of
the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became
man. He was crucified for us under Pontius Pilate,
and suffered and was buried; And He rose on
the third day, according to the Scriptures. He
ascended into heaven and is seated at the right
hand of the Father; And He will come again with
glory to judge the living and dead. His kingdom
shall have no end. 

And in the Holy Spirit, the
Lord, the Creator of life, Who proceeds from the
Father, Who together with the Father and the Son
is worshipped and glorified, Who spoke through
the prophets. 

In one, holy, catholic, and apostolic
Church. I confess one baptism for the forgiveness
of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and
the life of the age to come. 

Amen.
