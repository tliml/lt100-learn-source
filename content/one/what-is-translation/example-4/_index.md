### Genesis 49:10

*Hebrew text with word-for-word key in English:*


| לֹֽא־	יָס֥וּר | שֵׁ֙בֶט֙ | מִֽיהוּדָ֔ה | וּמְחֹקֵ֖ק | מִבֵּ֣ין | רַגְלָ֑יו |
| ------- | --- | ------ | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| lō'-yā·sūr | šê·ḇṭ | mî·hū·ḏā | ū·mə·ḥō·qêq | mib·bên | raḡ·lā |
| not-it-shall-depart | sceptre | from-Judah | and-commander's-staff | from-between | feet-his |

*English version A (The word-for-word key repeated):*  
Not-it-shall-depart sceptre from-Judah,  
And-commander's-staff from-between feet-his.

*English version B:*  
The sceptre shall not depart from Judah,  
nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, ...

*English version C:*  
Judah will hold the royal sceptre,  
And his descendants will always rule.  

Notes:  
A "sceptre" is a staff, a kind of stick, carried by a king as a symbol of his authority.  
"From between his feet" is a Hebrew idiom referring to a person's descendants.  
In this context, "Judah" refers to the tribe of Judah, not just to their ancestor Judah himself.

An alternative translation might be:  
The kings of the people will come from the tribe of Judah forever.  
His descendants will always rule.
