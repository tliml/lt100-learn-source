As you will see from the examples below, many quite different relationships are expressed by "of" phrases. This is especially true where one of the nouns expresses an EVENT idea.

At this point we are concerned primarily with discovering the relationship between the two parts of the "of" phrase. How the ideas might be expressed in the translation is a different question, which will be considered later in the full context of each passage.

Notice that in re-expressing the meaning, some participants have been made explicit. Information that has been made explicit is enclosed in parentheses ( ).

**EXAMPLES**

1. the making of a catechumen  (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.1) 
    **-->** *(someone) makes a catechumen*
1. the order of the sacrament   (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.1)
    **-->** *the way (someone) orders the sacrament*
1. shelter of your wings (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.1) **-->** *your wings shelter (someone)*
1. the saving Passion of our Lord (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.3) **-->** *our Lord suffered, and saved (someone)* [English has no verbal form of "passion," but in this context "passion" means "suffering."]
1. by the power of your invisible and spiritual right hand (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.8) **-->** *because your invisible and spiritual right hand is powerful*
1.  the sacrament of holy baptism   (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.1)
    **-->** *the sacrament which is holy baptism*
1. knowledge of salvation (Matins, tr. Lash, p.155) **-->** *the knowledge that (God) saves (someone)* 
1. the power, operation and descent of the Holy Spirit (Baptism, tr. Lash, p.7) **-->** *the Holy Spirit descends and operates powerfully*

**REMEMBER:**

"Of" phrases express many different relationships. Always study the phrase to discover what the relationship is between the parts. To help in discovering this, re-express EVENT ideas as VERBS.

**EXERCISE 1**

The following passages are taken from *The Order of the Sacrament of Holy Baptism*, translated by Fr. Ephrem Lash.

For each passage:

(1) First underline every "of" phrase, then

(2) re-express the meaning of the phrase in a way which makes the relationship between the parts clear.

Re-express all EVENT ideas as verbs. Make information explicit, where necessary, and enclose anything you have made explicit in brackets ( ). Look at each example in its context.

1. the Kingdom of the Father (Enarxis)
1. the commandments of Christ (Litany after the Gospel)
1. flock of your inheritance (Prayer for the Making of a Catechumen)
1. the great day of the judgement (First Exorcism)
1. an Angel of light (Third Exorcism)
1. soldier of Christ (First Exorcism)
1. his dread Coming (Second Exorcism)
1. the secrets of mortals (Prayer after the Great Litany)
1. voice of his/ her supplication (Prayer for the Making of a Catechumen)
