#### Original

Ἄξιόν ἐστιν ὡς ἀληθῶς μακαρίζειν σε τὴν
Θεοτόκον, τὴν ἀειμακάριστον καὶ παναμώμητον
καὶ μητέρα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν. Τὴν τιμιωτέραν τῶν
Χερουβεὶμ καὶ ἐνδοξοτέραν ἀσυγκρίτως τῶν
Σεραφείμ, τὴν ἀδιαφθόρως Θεὸν Λόγον τεκοῦσαν,
τὴν ὄντως Θεοτόκον, σὲ μεγαλύνομεν.

#### English (Lash)

It is truly right to call you
blessed, who gave birth to God,
ever-blessed and most pure, and
Mother of our God. Greater in honour
than the Cherubim and beyond
compare more glorious than the
Seraphim, without corruption you
gave birth to God the Word; truly
the Mother of God, we magnify you.

#### English (GOA)

It is truly right to bless you, Theotokos,
ever blessed, most pure, and Mother of our God.
More honorable than the Cherubim, and beyond
compare more glorious than the Seraphim, without
corruption you gave birth to God the Logos. We
magnify you, the true Theotokos.
