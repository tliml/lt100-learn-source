#### Original

Πάτερ ἡμῶν ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς, ἁγιασθήτω
τὸ ὄνομά σου. Ἐλθέτω ἡ βασιλεία σου. Γενηθήτω
τὸ θέλημά σου, ὡς ἐν οὐρανῷ καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς.
Τὸν ἄρτον ἡμῶν τὸν ἐπιούσιον δὸς ἡμῖν σήμερον.
Καὶ ἄφες ἡμῖν τὰ ὀφειλήματα ἡμῶν, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς
ἀφίεμεν τοῖς ὀφειλέταις ἡμῶν. Καὶ μὴ εἰσενέγκῃς
ἡμᾶς εἰς πειρασμόν, ἀλλὰ ρῦσαι ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τοῦ
πονηροῦ.

Ὅτι σοῦ ἐστιν ἡ βασιλεία καὶ ἡ δύναμις καὶ
ἡ δόξα τοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ καὶ τοῦ Ἁγίου
Πνεύματος, νῦν καὶ ἀεὶ καὶ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας τῶν
αἰώνων.

#### English (Lash)

Our Father, in heaven, *
may your name be sanctified, *
your kingdom come, * your will be
done * on earth as in heaven. *
Give us today our daily bread, * and
forgive us our debts, * as we forgive
our debtors, * and do not lead
us into temptation, * but deliver us
from the evil one.


For yours is the kingdom,
the power and the glory, Father,
Son and Holy Spirit, now and
for ever, and to the ages of ages.

#### English (GOA)

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be
Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us
not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.

For Thine is the Kingdom and the power and
the glory, of the Father and of the Son and of the
Holy Spirit, now and forever and to the ages of
ages.
